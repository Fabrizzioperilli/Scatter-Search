# Scatter Search

## Description

The main goal is to implement a hash table. In this case, open scattering and closed scattering can be used, also using different scattering techniques (Module, Sum, Pseudorandom) and different exploration techniques (linear, quadratic, double scattering, redispersion).
Hash table is a data structure used to store and retrieve values associated with a key. It works through a hash function that takes a key as 
input and produces an address in the table where the corresponding value is stored.

This program was developed in C++, for more information the documentation is in the /doc directory

## Usage

To compile the program, the *make* command is used in the main directory and the executable of the program is located in the /bin/main directory.
